What functionalities Trade Processor is performing

Reading --> Parsing --> Validating --> Writing to database

TradeProcessor can change in following situation:

1. Lets Say input but instead read the trades from a remote call to a web service.
2. if format of data changes and a new filed is introduced
3. A new rule for validation is introduced
4. Change in the way telemetry is managed
5. Changes to database model/stored procedure

Smells:

Design level smell: God Class 

Code smell : Long Method --> This is fixed with refactoring, as long method is now broken to smaller methods and logic is encapsulated inside the smaller functions
